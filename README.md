Simple Reverse-Proxy written in go.

Listen to a port and redirect any url matching a pattern to an oter port.

I made this as a solution for hosting multiple services on the same "url" without relying on port straight in the URL. Some companies/organizations block any request to a url using a port as one of their security measures.
